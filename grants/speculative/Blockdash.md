# **Blockdash - dashboard your blockchain network**
## Project Description
#### 1. Current problem in POS networks
- Hard to find information about validators for everybody (transparency)
- What are the largest validators in the POS network?
- How decentralized is the network? Are there any hidden validators which have the most traffic in the network?
- Monitoring (e.g. downtime) of validators only possible with technical knowledge. If a validator is down, it is a loss for the validator and the network.
- Validators have to actively search for information e.g. in case of mandatory validator updates
- How reliable is a validator?


#### 2. What is Blockdash?
- Monitor the healthstate of your validator with Blockdash at one click (e.g. get immediately informed when your validator is down, what is the current version of your validator etc.)
- Visualize the validators performance at one click
- Business Intelligence for validators
- Zoom into the POS network to a validator level and get detailed information about:
	- Overview of all validators in a network
	- What are the largest validators in the network?
	- How many transactions are on the validator?
	- ROI of a validator?
	- Fee structure of a validator


#### 3. Our solution
- Monitor the network
- Search or zoom in to the validators you are interested in
- Independent rating and grading system of validators
- View the most important health information (offline / online time of a validator, get informed when a validator is double-signing blocks etc.)
- Get notifications about validators slashing
- Subscribe for monitoring or timely update news for your validator
- Different membership options and featured extras such as direct support, business intelligence, weekly reports.

#### 9. Additional Information
Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.
Possible additional information to include:

What work has been done so far?

- We got familiar with Polkadot and visited various Web3 events, researched the best company location for this project, sketched the website and secured the basic infrastructure and domains. A polkadot validator was set-up on the testnet.

Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?

- Blockdash Ltd. is self-funded so far. 

Have you applied for other grants so far?

- No.

Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

- Nothing directly related to Polkadot. Tezos has a similar project: https://www.tezos-nodes.com/. Our strategic goal is to support ALL Web3 protocols and their validators once we have established the Polkadot validator dashboard.
